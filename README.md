## DESCRIPTION:

This is the ReadMe for Matthew Lawhorn's SvelteKit demo based on the course by [Fireship](https://fireship.io/courses/sveltekit/) <img src='./static/fireship.svg' width="20px"/>  

This is a full-stack application that uses:  
* <img src='./static/ts.svg' width="18px"/> TypeScript for strong type safety and a better dev experience
* <img src='./static/svelte.svg' width="18px"/> [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework
* <img src='./static/firebase.svg' width="18px"/> [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for handling the database, the storage bucket, and user authentation  
* <img src='./static/vercel.svg' width="18px"/> [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting  
* <img src='./static/tailwind.svg' width="18px"/> [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for rapid front-end development

Personally, this project was really cool. I've heard a lot of hype about SvelteKit, about it being  
many developers favourite frameworks, and it did not dissapoint. There was very little learning  
curve to writing Svelte components becuase it felt so similar to plain HTML & JavaScript.  
When things did get complicated, I found the docs well written which is nice.  
I will certainly be using it again in the future.
